**Warlot Inner File Documentation**

The _Inner File_ is a crucial component of the Walrus system. The Inner File object represents a transparent, restrictive, and trusted part of the Warlot architecture. It allows for controlled and auditable file modification within the Walrus protocol. In addition, the Inner File object enables collaborative file modification, providing a foundation for building more advanced collaboration features in the system.

**Problem Statement**

In the centralized ecosystem, there is no true consensus or standard for a transparent, secure, and trusted source for file modification and collaboration. Centralized systems often rely on opaque processes, which can lead to a lack of trust, accountability, and security in collaborative file management.

Walrus, as a decentralized storage protocol, allows users to store blobs securely. However, it does not natively support modification of these blobs once stored. While this immutability protects the integrity of stored data, it limits flexibility when users need to update or collaborate on files. The Inner File component is designed to address this limitation by providing a trusted mechanism for controlled file modification and collaboration within the decentralized Walrus ecosystem.

**Example Usage Scenarios**

The _Inner File_ creates a means to modify files in the system while still maintaining the **ownership** and **integrity** of each document. It allows for **group modification** of files in a trusted and transparent manner. Additionally, it gives trusted remote servers — such as the **Warlot server** — the ability to modify files (for example, large table files) on behalf of the user. This is especially important when files are too large to process efficiently on the user's local system.

1️⃣ **Collaborative Document Editing**
Multiple users working on a shared project can modify an Inner File representing the project’s documentation. Each change is tracked on the Walrus protocol, ensuring accountability while preserving the document owner’s control. Group edits happen securely, with unauthorized changes prevented.

---

2️⃣ **Versioned Configuration Files**
Administrators can collaboratively modify system configuration files stored as Inner Files. The protocol maintains file integrity and ownership at all times, allowing rollbacks to prior trusted versions without loss of transparency or control.

---

3️⃣ **Trusted Large File Modification**
When working with large files — such as database tables or massive datasets — trusted remote servers (e.g., the Warlot server) can securely modify these files on behalf of the user. This offloads heavy processing from the user's local machine while preserving trust, integrity, and ownership of the files.

---

4️⃣ **Decentralized Research Data Collaboration**
Researchers from multiple institutions can collaboratively modify shared datasets stored as Inner Files. All changes preserve data integrity, with the original owner retaining oversight while enabling secure group updates.

---

5️⃣ **Open Source Code Collaboration**
Developers can propose and apply code changes to Inner Files representing source code. The system protects file ownership while enabling group contributions and ensuring the integrity of the codebase.
